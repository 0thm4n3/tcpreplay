.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I tcpreplay
is a tool for replaying network traffic from files
saved with 
\fItcpdump(8)\fP
or
\fIsnoop(1M)\fP.
.LP
The basic operation of
.I tcpreplay
is to resend all packets from input file(s) at the speed at which
they were recorded, a specified data \fIrate\fP, or as fast as the hardware is 
capable.  
.LP
If no
\fIrate\fP or
\fImultiplier\fP are given, 
.I tcpreplay 
will replay packets at 10MBps.
.LP
By processing a \fIcache file\fP generated by \fItcpprep(8)\fP, tcpreplay 
is able to split traffic between two interfaces.  This is useful for testing 
bridges, routers, and other gateway devices. Also supported is rewriting of 
the destination \fIMAC addresses\fP to allow routers and other devices which 
proxy-arp to forward packets.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.B \-c
Specify the \fItcpprep cache\fR to use to process packets.
.TP
.B \-i
Specify the interface in which to send packets.
.TP
.B \-I
Specify the \fIdestination MAC\fR to use for packets being sent out the primary
interface.
.TP
.B \-j
Specify the \fIsecondary interface\fR in which to send packets.
.TP
.B \-J
Specify the \fIdestination MAC\fR to use for packets being sent out the 
secondary interface.
.TP
.B \-l
Resend the capture file(s) \fIloop count\fR times.
.TP
.B \-m
Resend the packets a \fImultiple\fR of the speed at which they were
recorded.
.TP
.B \-r
Resend the packets at the \fIrate\fR specified (in Mbps).
.TP
.B \-R
Resend the packets as fast as possible. Negates other speed options.
.TP
.B \-S
Indicates the specified files are in snoop format.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose mode, currently unused.

.SH BUGS
.I tcpreplay
can only send packets as fast as your machine's interface,
processor, and disk will allow.
.LP
``\fIN\fR write attempts failed from full buffers and were repeated''
indicates that kernel buffers were full and \fIN\fR packets had to
be resent.
.LP
Looping captured traffic may simulate odd conditions on a network.
For example, opening the same TCP connection multiple times may 
exhaust resources on machines tracking the connection. The 
.B \-l
flag is provided to allow faster sending on machines with greater I/O
constraints. 
.LP
Looping will not work when reading from stdin since tcpreplay closes 
then re-opens the file and re-reads it from the beginning.
.LP
On BSD-based systems, kernel modifications may be required to preserve
outgoing link layer source addresses. Refer to the \fIlibnet(3)\fP
documentation for more information on how to do this. Increasing
NMBCLUSTERS kernel option will help performance.
