For 1.4:

- Add in functionality to auto-write/apply IPTables/NetFilter, etc rules so 
	that if you're sending traffic with your own IP, the kernel won't
	try to reply (tcp resets for your fake connections, etc) 
	(libdnet can do this - mbing)

- Filter which packets to send/not send based on libpcap matching language

- Fix MAC rewriting to allow sending packets with a MAC of 00:00:00:00:00:00

- Look at VLAN packets
	- others non-vanilla types?

- Libnet 1.1 only

- Remove snoop 
	- use Ethereal to convert snoop & others to pcap

- Properly deal with alignment on Solaris

- Use system libpcap 
	- optionally keep libpcap.c hack?
	- use libpcap syntax when reading pcaps

- Modularize packet mangling interface

- Arbitrary number of interfaces

- Write a FAQ
	- basic usage
	- advanced usage
	- config files
	- compiling libpcap, libnet 
	- other pcap tools available

- Ports
	- support --with-pcap --with-libnet in the spec
	- up-to-date *BSD ports
