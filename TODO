- Add in functionality to auto-write/apply IPTables/NetFilter, etc rules so 
	that if you're sending traffic with your own IP, the kernel won't
	try to reply (tcp resets for your fake connections, etc)

- Filter which packets to send/not send based on libpcap matching language

- Fix MAC rewriting to allow sending packets with a MAC of 00:00:00:00:00:00

- Look at VLAN packets
