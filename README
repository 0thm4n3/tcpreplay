tcpreplay 1.1
-------------

tcpreplay is a tool to replay saved tcpdump or snoop files at 
arbitrary speeds.

This program was written in the hopes that a more precise testing
methodology might be applied to the area of network intrusion
detection, which is still a black art at best. 

Many NIDSs fare poorly when looking for attacks on heavily-loaded
networks. tcpreplay allows you to recreate real network traffic from a
real network for use in testing.

What's included with tcpreplay?
-------------------------------

tcpreplay - the tool for replaying capture files
tcpprep - a capture file pre-processor for creating cache files for tcpreplay
capinfo - the tool for printing statistics about capture files

Building tcpreplay
-------------------

Libnet v1.0.2a or better is required and is located at:

http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/libnet/

Note that Libnet 1.1.x is currently itself in beta and the tcpreplay code 
supporting 1.1.x should be considered alpha.  Hence, we currently recommend 
using 1.0.2a for production.

To build tcpreplay on a supported platform:

	% ./configure ; make

Installing tcpreplay
---------------------

To install tcpreplay, as root:

	# make install

This will install the binaries and man pages into /usr/local/ 
(by default).

On BSD-based systems, kernel modifications are required to correctly
forge outgoing Ethernet source MACs. See the libnet documentation for
details on how to do this.

Known Problems
--------------

tcpreplay can only replay traffic as fast as your hardware allows. If
you find you can't hit that 80 Mbps traffic rate you want, build a
faster machine (disk I/O seems to account for a lot of the overhead).
