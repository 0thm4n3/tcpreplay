 * FIXME: If you are creating an encoder plugin with any options
 * then you need to create API calls for each option so that the 
 * GUI or other programs using libtcpedit can set those values.
 *
 * Just uncomment the following headers, declare your methods in
 * ppp_api.h and write them here...
 
#include "common.h"
#include "tcpr.h"
#include "tcpedit.h"
#include "ppp_types.h"
