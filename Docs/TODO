For 2.x:

- Look at VLAN packets
	- others non-vanilla types?
    - Add tags?  Remove tags?  Change tags?

- Add support for setting the ethernet protocol field so we can use
    -I, -K to fill out an entire ethernet header w/o using -2

- Add a secondary interface full layer two rewrite option

- Improve flowreplay

- Fix MAC rewriting to allow sending packets with a MAC of 00:00:00:00:00:00

For 3.x:

- Modularize packet mangling interface (libnetdude?)

- Rip out packet munger from tcpreplay and put it into another tool so
  that tcpreplay can be more optimized

- Add support for dual-nic send on one intf, wait for packet, send next.

- Support fragrouter like features (basic IP fragmenation, then advanced)

- Support connection tracking and generating 3way handshake for connections
  missing them.

- Bump Syn/Ack numbers by a random or given value so that running the same pcap
  will behave as different streams.

- IPv6 support?
