1. Simple directions for Unix users:

cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
make
make install

2. Simple directions for everyone else:

Sorry you're out of luck.

Right now, Tcpreplay 4.0-Alpha only supports Unix based systems like Linux and
OS X.  I hope to add support for Windows as well, but I haven't gotten there yet.
If you're a Windows developer and are interested in helping port Tcpreplay to
Windows, please contact me!

3. Background

As of Tcpreplay 4.0, the build system has moved from GNU Autoconf to CMake.
While Autoconf may be the closest thing to an "industry standard", it's 
also unfortunately very difficult to use and does not allow for building
native Windows applications.
