NOTE: This information is out of date.  Please see the tcpreplay wiki
for updated information: http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/trac/wiki/manual

You'll need:

- libnet 1.1.x (1.1.1 or greater is recommended)
http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/libnet/

Note: Version 1.1.3-RC has a bug in one of the header files.  If you get
an error during compilation:

/usr/local/include/./libnet/libnet-types.h:36:23: error: ../config.h: No
such file or directory 

Then you should edit /usr/local/include/libnet/libnet-types.h (or wherever
it is installed) and comment out or delete the three lines (should be lines
35-38):

#ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
#include "../config.h"
#endif

Feel free to bitch to libnet@securityfocus.com since they seem to be
ignoring me.

- libpcap >= 0.5 (0.8 or greater is recommended)
http://www.tcpdump.org/

- tcpdump (Optional. If you want packet decoding of sent packets)
http://www.tcpdump.org/

- autogen >= 5.7.0 (Only necessary if you are building tcpreplay from 
      subversion)
http://autogen.sourceforge.net/

If building from subversion:
./autogen.sh

Run:
./configure ; make

Run as root:
make test -i    (optional)
make install
