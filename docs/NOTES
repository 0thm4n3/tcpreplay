1) There seems to be some wierd issue (on Intel at least) where
    if you overlay a Layer 2 header (eth_hdr_t, etc) over the 
    packet buffer, the protocol field comes across as 
    little endian rather then NBO.   Doesn't make much sense.

2) Bug with autoopts under OS X.  Bruce is looking into it but it might
"take a few weeks" to get back to me since he's busy.  01/11/05.
