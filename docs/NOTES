1) There seems to be some wierd issue (on Intel at least) where
    if you overlay a Layer 2 header (eth_hdr_t, etc) over the 
    packet buffer, the protocol field comes across as 
    little endian rather then NBO.   Doesn't make much sense.

2) Bug with autoopts under OS X.  Bruce is looking into it but it might
"take a few weeks" to get back to me since he's busy.  01/11/05.

3) Libnet is nice, but requires all my applications to run as root which sucks.
I should investigate better alternatives for common libnet functions such as
calculating IP/L4 checksums.

4) Why is SunFreeware.com shipping tcpreplay 1.0?  Damn.  Need to give them a
new package.

5) Layer 1 (DLT) and Layer 2 rewriting is broken.  There are wierd dependancies between the two and I need a design doc.

Requirements:
- Accept arbitrary DLT types for in and output
- Both input handles (if available) must be the same DLT
- Need to know the layer two length for each DLT type.  Note, that in some cases the length is variable (ethernet's 802.1q vlan tagged frames for example)
    - Obviously, tagged and untagged frames can exist in the same capture.
- Should be able to convert frames in one DLT to frames in another DLT
- Need to support rewriting ethernet headers
- Should support utilizing existing data in L2 header when converting to ethernet (l3 proto, source mac in Linux SLL)
- Examples:
  - Cisco HDLC, Linux SLL, RAW, NULL to ethernet
  - 802.1 to 802.1q
  - 802.1q to 802.1
  - Anything to any arbitrary DLT given --dlink

if (!--dlt)
    dst DLT = src DLT

if (src DLT != EN10MB and --vlan)
    FAIL
if (--dlt and --dlink)
    OK
else if (--dlt=1 and source DLT in (HDLC, SLL, RAW, NULL) and --smac/--dmac)
    OK
else if (src DLT == dst DLT)
    OK
else if (--dlt)
    FAIL
