1) There seems to be some wierd issue (on Intel at least) where
    if you overlay a Layer 2 header (eth_hdr_t, etc) over the 
    packet buffer, the protocol field comes across as 
    little endian rather then NBO.   Doesn't make much sense.

2) Bug with autoopts under OS X.  Bruce is looking into it but it might
"take a few weeks" to get back to me since he's busy.  01/11/05.

3) Libnet is nice, but requires all my applications to run as root which sucks.
I should investigate better alternatives for common libnet functions such as
calculating IP/L4 checksums.

4) Why is SunFreeware.com shipping tcpreplay 1.0?  Damn.  Need to give them a
new package.
