.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I tcpreplay
is a tool for replaying network traffic from files saved with 
\fItcpdump(8)\fP.
.LP
The basic operation of
.I tcpreplay
is to resend all packets from input file(s) at the speed at which
they were recorded, a specified data \fIrate\fP, or as fast as the hardware is 
capable.  
.LP
If no
\fIrate\fP or
\fImultiplier\fP are given, 
.I tcpreplay 
will replay packets at the speed they were captured from the wire.
.LP
By processing a \fIcache file\fP generated by \fItcpprep(8)\fP, tcpreplay 
is able to split traffic between two interfaces.  This is useful for testing 
bridges, routers, and other gateway devices. Also supported is the rewriting of 
destination \fIMAC addresses\fP to allow routers and other devices which 
proxy-arp to forward packets.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.B \-c or "cachefile"
Specify the \fItcpprep cache\fR to use to process packets.
.TP
.B \-C or "cidr"
Given a list of CIDR networks, packets with a source address matching an 
entry in the list are sent out the primary interface. All other packets
are sent via the secondary interface. CIDR lists are comma-separated 
and do not contain spaces, \fI192.168.0.0/28,10.0.0.0/16\fR and 
\fI10.1.1.0/29\fR, for example. Overrides the -c option.
.TP
.B \-D or "datadump_mode"
When used in conjunction with -w and -W, rather then dumping the entire
packets to the files, only the layer 7 data is dumped.
.B \-f 
Specify a file that contains configuration options. 
Option tokens are listed below next to the corresponding command-line flag.
.TP
.B \-F or "fixchecksums"
Fixes IP and TCP/UDP checksums in packets.  Auto-forced with -s or -u
.TP
.B \-h
Prints help/usage
.TP
.B \-i or "intf"
Specify the interface in which to send packets.
.TP
.B \-I or "primary_mac"
Specify the \fIdestination MAC\fR to use for packets being sent out the primary
interface.
.TP
.B \-j or "second_intf"
Specify the \fIsecondary interface\fR in which to send packets.
.TP
.B \-J or "second_mac"
Specify the \fIdestination MAC\fR to use for packets being sent out the 
secondary interface.
.TP
.B \-l or "loop"
Resend the capture file(s) \fIloop count\fR times.  Setting this to 0 (zero)
will cause tcpreplay to loop infinitely.
.TP
.B \-m or "multiplier"
Resend the packets at a \fImultiple\fR of the speed at which they were
recorded, specified as a floating-point number.
.TP
.B \-M or "no_martians"
Disable sending martian packets (source networks: 0/8, 127/8, 255/8)
.TP
.B \-o or "offset"
Jump to packet at the nearest specified byte offset and start replaying packets from there.
.TP
.B \-p or "packetrate"
Specify the replay rate in packets per second.  Negates all other 
speed options.
.TP
.B \-P
.br
Print the PID of the tcpreplay process at startup.  Useful when wanting to
use SIGUSR1 and SIGCONT to pause/restart.
.TP
.B \-r or "rate"
Resend the packets at \fIrate\fR megabits per-second, specified as a 
floating-point number.
.TP
.B \-R or "topspeed"
Resend the packets as fast as possible. Negates all other speed options.
.TP
.B \-s or "seed"
Specify a seed value to allow rewriting the source and destination IP
addresses (only in IP header) to pseudo-random values.  Will also recalculate 
the IP header as necessary.
.TP
.B \-t or "mtu"
Specify the MTU in bytes of the interface(s) being used.  Default is 1500 which
is standard for 10/100 Ethernet.
.TP
.B \-T or "truncate"
If a packet is larger then the MTU of the interface, the frame will be truncated
so that it can be sent.  With out this, these frames are skipped.  Not to be
confused with -u which pads/truncates packets which are larger then the snaplen
used to capture the packet.
.TP
.B \-u or "untruncate"
When a packet is truncated in the capture file because the snaplen was too small, 
this option will \fIpad\fR the end of the packet with zeros, or 
truncate (\fItrunc\fR) it by re-adjusting the length in the IP header. 
The \fItrunc\fR option will only alter IPv4 packets, all others will be sent 
unmodified.
.TP
.B \-v or "verbose"
.br
Verbose mode, currently unused.
.TP
.B \-V
Print version info and exit.
.TP
.B -w or "write"
Specify the output file to write the primary packets to instead of the network.
You still must specify the primary interface via -i.  If -D is set before it,
it will write only the layer 7 data.
.TP
.B -W or "secondary_write"
Specify the output file to write the secondary packets to instead of the 
network.  You still must specify the secondary interface via -j.  If -D is 
set before it, it will write only the layer 7 data.
.TP
.B \-x or "include"
Specifies which packets from the capture file(s) to send.  Can be one of:
.br
.br
S:<CIDR1>,... - Src IP must match specified CIDR(s)
.br
D:<CIDR1>,... - Dst IP must match specified CIDR(s)
.br
B:<CIDR1>,... - Both src and dst addresses must match
.br
E:<CIDR1>,... - Either src or dst address must match
.br
P:<list>      - Must be one of the listed packets where the list corresponds to the
packet number in the capture file.  Ex: -x P:1-5,9,15 would only send packets 1 
through 5, 9 and 15.
.br
F:"<filter>"  - BPF filter.  See the tcpdump(8) man page for syntax.
.TP
.B \-X or "exclude"
Specifies which packets from the capture file(s) to NOT send.  Can be one of:
.br
S:<CIDR1>,... - Src IP must match specified CIDR(s)
.br
D:<CIDR1>,... - Dst IP must match specified CIDR(s)
.br
B:<CIDR1>,... - Both src and dst addresses must match
.br
E:<CIDR1>,... - Either src or dst address must match
.br
P:<list>      - Must be one of the listed packets where the list corresponds to the
packet number in the capture file.  Ex: -X P:1-5,9,15 would send all packets except 1 
through 5, 9 and 15.
.TP
.B \-2 or l2data
Specifies a string of comma seperated numbers in hex to be used instead of the Layer
2 header in the packet.  Useful for converting between 802.x types or adding a header 
when the pcap file doesn't contain a header (as in the case of DLT_RAW).  Currently
this only supports the following pcap(3) types: DLT_EN10MB and DLT_RAW.
.SH SIGNALS
